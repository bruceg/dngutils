mrwtodng \- Convert Minolta raw (MRW) files to digital negatives (DNG)
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B OPTIONS

.I SOURCE.mrw DESTINATION.dng
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program converts raw images from Minolta digital cameras to Adobe
digital negative files.  The resulting file includes the thumbnail
embeded in the makernotes section for a preview image.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c, --compress
Compress the raw image data.  This is the default.
.TP
.B -C, --no-compress
Do not compress the raw image data.  Since the image data in the
original MRW file is packed but DNG doesn't support such packing, this
produces output files approximately 25% larger than the source.
.TP
.B -t, --tile
Break compressed data into tiles.  This is the default.  Uncompressed
data is never tiled.
.TP
.B -T, --no-tile
Compress the entire data as one block.
.TP
.B -h, --tile-height=UNS
The maximum height of all the tiles in pixels.
.TP
.B -w, --tile-width=UNS
The maximum width of all the tiles in pixels.  Since pixels are
compressed in pairs, this number must be even.
.SH NOTES
The default tile size is computed from the input file width and height
to be the number between 256 and 512 that leaves the fewest leftover
pixels to encode.  The limits of 256 and 512 were chosen after
experimentation of various tile sizes over a number of MRW files.  Both
larger and smaller sizes produced worse results in general.
.P
Unlike most compressed data formats, breaking up the compressed data
into tiles can frequently actually reduce the total size of the
compressed data.  Tiled data also lets multi-threaded DNG loaders
decompress different parts of the raw data in parallel.
.SH BUGS
This program has only been tested with MRW files from a Minolta Maxxum
7D.  It likely will not work without adjustments with other Minolta
digital cameras.  If you would like support for your Minolta digital
camera, please send me sample files and I will make the necessary
adjustments.
.P
The output files from this program do not validate with the
dng_validate.exe program included with Adobe's DNG SDK when compression
and tiling are both enabled.  The error message gives no details as to
why it does not validate, and the source code in the SDK is similarly
unenlightening.  Both uncompressed and non-tiled images validate with no
problems.  The compressed tiled DNG files work fine with all the RAW
programs I tried (dcraw, ufraw, RawTherapee, and LightZone), so I have
been unable to correct this flaw.
